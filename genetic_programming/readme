To run GPac with controller being uniform random generator for ghosts
and evolved state estimator using genetic programming for Ms. Pac-Man
with default configurations:
    python GPac.py
This will create the output files:
    output/1.log
    output/1.wld
    output/1.sol
    
To run with a specified configuration file (.cfg):
    python GPac.py -config <path to config.cfg>
Example:
    python GPac.py -config config/2.cfg

Code is tested with python 3.4

Solution file represents the best tree found in the whole experiment.
Nodes of the tree at each depth are shown in the same line where the
very first line shows the root of the tree and the last line shows
the leaves. The following symbols are used for nodes:

Functions:
+: Addition of the left and right children
-: Subtraction of the left and right children
*: Multiplication of the left and right children
/: Division of the left and right children
rand: Choose a random number uniformly between its given left and right children

Terminals:
G: The Manhattan distance between Ms. Pac-Man and the nearest ghost
P: The Manhattan distance between Ms. Pac-Man and the nearest pill
C: A random number between -20 and 20
